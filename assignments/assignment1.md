# Assignment 1

## List of Domains, Short Phrase, And Explanation of why I am Interested in 3 of the Domains
1. **Fanfiction**: Fanfiction is stories written by fans about media they like.
    - I love fanfiction. People think it's a relatively new thing, but people have been writing stories about other people's fiction since the dawn of time. Fanfiction has only gotten more popular with the help of websites such as *Archive of Our Own*, *Fanfiction.net*, and *Wattpad*. While all of these have their strengths, they also have key weaknesses which mean it's a great opportunity to improve upon them.
2. **Mentorship**: For when a newcomer needs to find someone to help them learn, for jobs, hobbies, etc.
3. **Theme parks**: A theme park is an area where there are games and attractions.
4. **Skincare**: Everyone's skin is very different, which makes taking care of it difficult.
5. **Digital Art**: Art done with the use of electronics, such as on a tablet or computer.
6. **Costuming**: Creating DIY Costumes can be difficult and take a lot of time.
7. **Memories**: Memories are the key moments of people's lives; arguably, memories are what make a person themselves.
    - I'm incredibly interested in memories, as I see them as snapshots of my life that are imperative to remember-- even the most mundane ones. Whenever something memorable occurs, I take the time to write it down in a note document, so that I can look back on them fondly. Photos are great ways to remember occasions, but memories and events of someone's life doesn't just convey what they look like and where they were, it also conveys their personalities.
8. **Home Ownership**: Buying, selling, and owning a house can be a monumentous occasion in people's lives.
9. **Video Game Modding**: Players can make games more fun and lengthen their shelf lives by modding them.
    - I love video games and especially love playing ones with hidden (oftentimes harder) routes. The only issue? I'm awful at them. So even if I would like to play a game as a treat, sometimes I just can't get past a level, and lose interest. For instance, I have a 25-page lore and theory document on *Deltarune* and have a blast playing the easier parts, but I also go to MIT and can't spend hours upon hours of my time trying to beat the hardest boss in the game. Thus, it would be extremely helpful if there was a *safe* way to categorize and download mods that help make the game just a little bit easier.
10. **Communal Living**: In most people's lives, they will share a room or a house with others, which can cause friction.

### The Most Promising 3 Domains and an Explanation
1. **Fanfiction**: Because fanfiction websites are relatively new and unrefined, this makes for a perfect opportunity to see what works and what could be done better. For instance, although *Archive of Our Own* (AO3) is considered the gold standard of fanfiction websites, many people complain about the steep learning curve when it comes to searching for fanfic. And although Wattpad is popular amongst the younger generation, most consider its UI to be unusable and clunky.
2. **Memories**: A way to categorize and share memories would be a perfect way to remember our loved ones. Not like a social media post, but rather key moments of their lives, their personalities, and what made them special to others. My grandmother just wrote an autobiography just so she could share key moments of her life with my family. The ideal situation would be a way for everyone to contribute to a big bank of memories, so that people who loved them, or even future generations, can remember what a person is/was like as a person.
3. **Costuming**: I love making big costumes for Halloween! But it is so difficult to create them sometime, especially because I don't yet have the time to learn to sew. If I could find key articles that would complete a costume in my local area, that would be perfect.

## Problems For Domains
### Domains
#### Fanfiction
1. **Fanfiction is hard to find**: Although AO3 has a great selection of fanfic, finding good ones are nigh impossible, mostly because the main and only ways people find fanfic is through seeing what was added most recently, and what has the highest likes (kudos). Tags are a great help in finding fanfiction, but oftentimes people don't tag things perfectly which leads to fanfic not getting found even if it's what people are looking for. For instance, there can be a tag that says "Spoiler: found family" that will not show up if someone looks for "found family", thus people won't actually be able to find this fic, even if it's what they want. This can lead to *over-tagging* (aka "seagull fics"), where authors tag everything under the sun in their fanfic, ironically leaving readers even more frusturated upon seeing a tag they're interested in, going to the fic, then realizing the fic only contains a microscopic amount of that tag. There's an advanced search function, where people can search for key words in a summary, but this still doesn't find fics that have essentially the same meaning but not the same word. For instance, "Father-figure (character)" and "Dad (character)" mean the same thing but both wouldn't show up if you search for one and not the other. There is an OR function, so you could search both, but then you need to guess every possible variation of "Parent (character)" which is infeasible. Furthermore, there isn't really a guide on how to use the advanced search function. I had to find certain functions and operations, such as the "otp:" function, through an admin commenting about it on an obscure Reddit post, which is... not ideal.
2. **Lack of engagement (mostly of comments)**: When authors don't get feedback on their fanfiction, they feel disheartened and don't continue writing. Creating fanfiction is not a job, and they do this for the love of the game. So if that love fades due to a lack of reception, they'll simply stop.
3. **Difficulty saving memorable fanfiction**: Fanfic always is in danger of being deleted if the author no longer wishes to have it on the archive.

#### Memories
1. **Sharing memories with community**: who will listen? How can you find people to share memories with?
2. **Memories fade as time goes on**: Remembering what happened as time goes on gets muddier and muddier if not thought about or recorded often.
3. **Memories are fallible**: Even if thought about often, memories are still fallible and you can't possibly get the whole truth from one person's tale.

#### Costuming
1. **Niche materials**: For some costumes, finding the perfect item is like finding needles in a haystack.
2. **Time required for creating a costume**: For particularly elaborate costumes, people can work on them for months and run out of time.
3. **Buying a whole outfit just to wear for a couple of occasions**: Having an entire outfit you can only wear on certain occasions is both expensive and wasteful.

### Selected Problems and Justification
1. **Fanfiction: Better Fic Finder**: A better way to find fanfiction would be good for both readers and writers. Readers can satisfy their interests without having to sift through multiple tags that convey the almost-same, but slightly diffferent meaning, and authors can get more readers without having to guess at what people will search for. It would be slightly difficult, but since AO3 is completely open source, I wouldn't have to start from scratch.
2. **Memories: Fading Memories**: An archive of memories would be a great way for people to share their favorite memories of people, events, etc. that could be easily implemented yet make people's lives so much better, both for people interested in the past and those who don't want to forget excellent moments of their lives.
3. **Costuming: Limited Use Outfit**: If there was a way to only rent certain articles of clothing or be able to return them after use, that would make creating costumes much less costly and much more sustainable. If people want to dress as the same character, they could simply wait instead of buying the same article of clothing, which makes it more sustainable as well.

### Unselected Problems and Justification
1. **Fanfiction**
    1. **Lack of comments**: Having an incentive to leave comments would lead to *unintended consequences*, such as low-quality comments like "Leaving a comment so I get (incentive)", which would further drive authors off the site.
    2. **Difficulty saving memorable fanfic**: Forcing authors to never delete fanfic would *ignore key stakeholders*, as no author would want to join the site if they could never go back and edit fanfic they find embarassing, or if they accidentally doxxed themselves and couldn't remove it.
2. **Memories**
    1. **Community**: This would probably be best suited in real life, as you can find friends or family to talk about memories with face-to-face. It would be more difficult to force strangers to listen to these stories.
    2. **Fallible**: It's impossible to correct the fallibility of the mind, and even if you get multiple people's stories of the same event it still won't be the same as the simple truth. Unless you recorded every single point in everyone's life, but I don't think people would be open to that concept.
3. **Costuming**
    1. **Niche materials**: Niche items of clothing can be substituted for slightly incorrect, but good enough items that work. If someone is that desperate for perfection, they can make the article of clothing themselves.
    2. **Time required for creating a costume**: The time commitment required for creating a costume can be kept on track by a reminder or calendar, and thus has *insufficient differentiation*.

## Stakeholders

### Fanfiction: Better Fic Finder
1. **Readers** (those searching for fanfic): Readers are impacted by the search function because they don't know if they are missing out on stories perfect for them because an author forgot to tag a trope they admire. They're also impacted by authors who tag *too much* in fear of losing audience, so they tag things (like characters) that don't matter to the story, yet still appear briefly, which bloats the tag with fluff. There's not an official way of listing someone as a main character, nor relationships. Readers who want to find fics where a certain plotline happens, but doesn't have a tag, won't be able to find them. Thus, readers are irritated when searching for fanfic.
2. **Authors** (those posting fanfic): Authors are the ones who have to tag their fics, so if they tag it incorrectly or don't know how to tag it, this can draw ire from long-term fans, who will block them. If undertagged, authors miss out on audiences.
3. **Staff** (those who moderate fanfic): Volunteers often spend an inordinate amount of time "tag-wrangling", seeing if tags should appear as synonymous or subtags for other tags, such as "Werewolf Jon" being a subtag for "Werecreature Jon" but not synonymous with "Alternate Universe - Werewolf" because those looking for "Werewolf Jon" don't want to see Werewolves that aren't Jon, which would show up in "Alternate Universe - Werewolf". This wastes a lot of time, as you can tag literally anything you want, and still doesn't work quite perfectly.

### Memories: Fading Memories
1. **Storytellers** (those who tell stories): Storytellers are impacted by fading memories because they can no longer find joy in stories that used to make them laugh, and memories they may cherish will be lost to time.
2. **Listeners** (those who read/listen to stories): Listeners may be disappointed when the Storyteller cannot remember the memory in as much detail as they would hope. They cannot pass on stories that they don't hear/read.
3. **Characters** (those present within stories): Characters are impacted because they may eventually be forgotten by the person who tells their story. Characters might also not enjoy how they are portrayed in a memory.

### Costuming: Limited Use Outfit
1. **Sellers** (those selling clothing): Sellers may seem to make more money by limited-use costumes, but actually may lose out on money by people who don't want to spend that much money on a costume and then have it clutter up their room, and instead forgo costume-making.
2. **Costumers** (those wearing the costumes): Costumers are impacted by limited use outfits because they are both expensive and don't have a good use for anything else, so they may just be thrown away afterwards.
3. **Suppliers** (those who supply the material to be used for the costume): Suppliers are impacted because they will be using supplies that could be reused instead for a costume that won't get much use, and may eventually be thrown out.
